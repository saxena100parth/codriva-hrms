## üß™ **Complete Test Steps**

### **Step 1: Admin Approves Employee Onboarding**

}
```

Congratulations! Your onboarding has been approved.

Official Email: employee@company.com

Automatic redirect to: http://localhost:3000/login
```

## üîç **Debugging Checklist**

### **If Step 3 Fails (White Screen/Mobile Error):**
1. Check backend console for `needsPasswordReset: true`
2. Check frontend console for auth state logs
3. Verify `hasTemporaryPassword` is set in database
4. Check ProtectedRoute redirect logic

### **If Step 4 Fails (Password Reset Not Showing):**
1. Check `/password-reset` route exists
2. Verify PasswordReset component imports
3. Check console for component rendering logs

### **If Step 5 Fails (Password Update Error):**
1. Check API endpoint `/auth/change-password`
2. Verify current password matches
3. Check password validation rules

### **If Step 6 Fails (No Redirect to Login):**
1. Check logout function works
2. Verify navigate('/login') call
3. Check for JavaScript errors

### **If Step 7 Fails (Can't Login with New Password):**
1. Verify password was actually updated in database
2. Check `hasTemporaryPassword` is false
3. Verify password hashing is working
